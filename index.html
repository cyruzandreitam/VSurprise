    <h4>I hope you don't find this website too cheesy, but you're always making something
        from hand just for me, and I'd like to do the same -but my way hehe...
        <h4>I don't even know where to begin...</h4>
        <h4>I thank God and the universe every day because you are the most precious blessing that I've ever received.
        If I were to say how thankful I am for you, there would be a list of a hundred reasons.
        But I do want to say thank you for being my best friend. I know I've said it a thousand times but I am really 
        grateful for your love. You chose to give your love and trust in me, and I will gladly accept the opportunity to
        cherish and protect it with all my heart. You remind me that no matter how tough life gets or whatever situation 
        we are put in, we will always come out on top, giving each other the best version of ourselves. 
        We have never lost our spark; it has always been burning and burning, waiting for the perfect moment to ignite.
        I can confidently say that I Love You, and I always will.  
        </h4>

    <h5>This message right here gave me goosebumps.
        The talking stage is that sweet, uncertain, and exciting phase before a relationship starts. 
        It started with playful inside jokes, and then we gave each other a taste of whatever we found humorous.
        Remember when we both laughed at the Lego water bottle? It stuck to me as a core memory. </h5>

    <h5 class="pacifico-font">My First Impression of You</h5>
    <h5>The first time we talked, it felt so nice and refreshing to connect with an old friend.
        I loved how you carried yourself, you were sweet and easy to talk to, it felt like I could 
        have an unending conversation with you and I'd enjoy every second of it. 
        You had this energy that pulled me close and a warmth that wanted me to stay.
        You were funny, kind, and beautiful inside and out.
        From that moment on, you've been my favorite person, and I wouldn't change a single thing
        about how it all started.</h5>

<h3>The First Date</h3>
<h6>Oh man this was pretty scary.
    This was the first time we were going to meet in person, 
    and I was so nervous. Many thoughts running through my head...
    "What if she doesn't like me?" "What if I'm not what she expected?"
    But asoon as I saw you, all my worries disappeared. You were so beautiful,
    I knew I had to cherish every moment and time with you.

    <h3>To my Princess...</h3>
    <h5>This isn't my usual love letter to you, but I wanted to try something different.
        I wanted to make something that will last and something you could always look back to and smile, with
        a simple click of a URL of course.
        Everything on this page was made with my whole heart to every little detail and text. Trust me coding
        is a pain in the booty cheeks. My only regret is not starting this fun little project any sooner
        because I had a blast making this for you and I have so much more ideas in my head. 
        Take this as a fraction of what I have to offer you, and I can't wait to show you more.
        Thank you for being my inspiration and motivation- not just in making this project but in everything I do.  
        I hope you enjoyed this little website I made for you, and I wanted you to know that you will always have 
        a special place in my heart.
